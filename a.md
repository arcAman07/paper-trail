- **Authors**: Gemma Team, Google DeepMind
- **Release Date**: March 12, 2025

## Executive Summary

Google DeepMind's Gemma 3 represents a significant evolution in the open language model landscape, introducing multimodal capabilities, extended context lengths, and architectural innovations focused on memory efficiency. Available in sizes from 1B to 27B parameters, these models achieve performance levels that allow smaller variants to compete with larger predecessors, with the Gemma 3-4B-IT rivaling Gemma 2-27B-IT, and Gemma 3-27B-IT performing comparably to Gemini-1.5-Pro across benchmarks.

## 1. Architectural Innovations

### 1.1 Base Architecture

Gemma 3 builds on the decoder-only transformer foundation established in previous versions with several critical refinements:

```
Base Architecture = Decoder-only Transformer + GQA + RMSNorm + QK-norm
```

- **Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)**: Improves efficiency by sharing key and value projections across multiple query heads
- **Normalization scheme**: Hybrid approach using both post-norm and pre-norm with RMSNorm
- **QK-norm**: Replaces the soft-capping mechanisms from Gemma 2, inspired by Dehghani et al. (2023), Wortsman et al. (2023), and Chameleon Team (2024)

### 1.2 Local-Global Attention Interleaving (5:1 Ratio)

The most significant architectural innovation is the pattern of attention layer interleaving:

- **Local attention layers**: Implement sliding window self-attention with span limited to 1024 tokens
- **Global attention layers**: Provide full context attention
- **Interleaving pattern**: 5 local layers for every 1 global layer, beginning with a local layer

Mathematical representation of attention mechanisms:

For local attention with window size $w$, a token at position $i$ attends only to tokens at positions $j$ where:

$$j \in [max(0, i-w/2), min(n, i+w/2)]$$

This reduces the computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(nw)$ where $n$ is the sequence length.

The model's architecture can be described as:

$$\text{Layer}_i = \begin{cases}
\text{LocalAttention}(x, \text{span}=1024) & \text{if } i \bmod 6 \neq 0 \\
\text{GlobalAttention}(x) & \text{if } i \bmod 6 = 0
\end{cases}$$

This pattern achieves a dramatic reduction in memory requirements while maintaining performance, as validated by ablation studies showing minimal perplexity impact even at 7:1 ratios.

### 1.3 Long Context Support (128K tokens)

To enable effective processing of sequences up to 128K tokens (32K for the 1B model):

- **RoPE base frequency**: Increased from 10k to 1M on global self-attention layers, kept at 10k for local layers
- **Positional interpolation**: Similar to Chen et al. (2023) to extend the span of global attention layers
- **Scaling approach**: Models initially trained with 32K sequences, then scaled to 128K using positional interpolation with a scaling factor of 8

### 1.4 Vision Modality Integration

#### 1.4.1 Vision Encoder

The vision component utilizes:

- **SigLIP architecture**: 400M parameter variant of SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023)
- **Training approach**: Vision Transformer trained with CLIP-like loss function
- **Input specification**: Square images at 896 × 896 resolution
- **Parameter efficiency**: Same frozen encoder shared across 4B, 12B, and 27B models
- **Token representation**: Each image condensed to 256 token embeddings

#### 1.4.2 Pan & Scan (P&S) Algorithm

To handle variable aspect ratios and maintain text readability in images:

1. Images are segmented into non-overlapping crops of equal size
2. Each crop is resized to 896×896 pixels
3. Crops collectively cover the entire image
4. Algorithm adaptively applied only when necessary
5. Controls implemented for maximum number of crops

Ablation studies demonstrate significant performance improvements with P&S:
- DocVQA: +4.8 to +8.2 percentage points
- InfoVQA: +12.9 to +17.0 percentage points

## 2. Training Methodology

### 2.1 Pre-training Data and Scale

The models were trained on significantly larger token volumes than previous versions:

| Model | Token Budget |
|-------|--------------|
| 1B    | 2T tokens    |
| 4B    | 4T tokens    |
| 12B   | 12T tokens   |
| 27B   | 14T tokens   |

Data composition includes:
- Mixed image and text data
- Increased multilingual content (both monolingual and parallel)
- Improved language representation balance using strategies from Chung et al. (2023)

### 2.2 Tokenizer

Gemma 3 utilizes the same tokenizer as Gemini 2.0:
- SentencePiece tokenizer with split digits
- Preserved whitespace
- Byte-level encodings (Kudo and Richardson, 2018)
- 262k vocabulary entries
- Optimized for better non-English language representation

### 2.3 Knowledge Distillation

All models are trained using knowledge distillation with the following approach:

1. Sample 256 logits per token, weighted by teacher probabilities
2. Student learns teacher's distribution within these samples via cross-entropy loss
3. Teacher's target distribution set to zero for non-sampled logits and renormalized

A notable finding from ablation studies is the relationship between teacher size and training duration:
- Short training horizons: smaller teacher performs better
- Long training horizons: larger teacher yields superior results

This suggests previous research favoring smaller teachers may have been limited by insufficient training duration.

### 2.4 Compute Infrastructure

Training leveraged a combination of hardware platforms:

| Model | Hardware | # Chips | Sharding Configuration |
|-------|----------|---------|------------------------|
| 1B    | TPUv5e   | 512     | 16 data × 16 sequence × 2 replica |
| 4B    | TPUv5e   | 2048    | 16 data × 16 sequence × 8 replica |
| 12B   | TPUv4    | 6144    | 16 data × 16 sequence × 24 replica |
| 27B   | TPUv5p   | 6144    | 24 data × 8 sequence × 32 replica |

The training infrastructure utilized:
- ZeRO-3 sharding (Ren et al., 2021) for optimizer state
- Pathways approach (Barham et al., 2022) for data replica reduction
- JAX/Pathways programming model (Roberts et al., 2023)
- GSPMD partitioner (Xu et al., 2021)
- MegaScale XLA compiler (XLA, 2019)

### 2.5 Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)

To enable efficient deployment:
- ~5,000 steps of fine-tuning with QAT
- Probabilities from non-quantized checkpoint used as targets
- Three weight representation formats supported:
  1. Per-channel int4
  2. Per-block int4
  3. Switched fp8

Memory footprint (in GB) for different quantization formats (27B model):
- Base weights: Raw (54.0) vs Int4 (14.1) vs SFP8 (27.4)
- With KV cache (32K tokens): Raw (72.7) vs Int4 (32.8) vs SFP8 (46.1)

## 3. Instruction Tuning Methodology

### 3.1 Advanced Training Techniques

The instruction-tuned variants employ a multi-phase approach:

1. **Knowledge distillation**: From a large IT teacher model (Agarwal et al., 2024; Anil et al., 2018; Hinton et al., 2015)
2. **Reinforcement learning**: Using improved variants of:
   - BOND: Aligning LLMs with Best-of-N Distillation (Sessa et al., 2024)
   - WARM: Weight Averaged Reward Models (Ramé et al., 2024b)
   - WARP: Weight Averaged Rewarded Policies (Ramé et al., 2024a)

### 3.2 Multi-objective Learning

The instruction tuning optimizes for diverse capabilities simultaneously:

- **Helpfulness**: Weight averaged reward models trained on human feedback
- **Mathematics**: Ground-truth rewards for problem-solving (DeepSeek-AI, 2025; Lambert et al., 2024)
- **Code execution**: Feedback from running generated code (Gehring et al., 2024)
- **Reasoning**: Multi-step problem solving
- **Multilingual performance**: Cross-lingual capabilities
- **Safety**: Minimizing harmful outputs

### 3.3 Data Filtering and Preparation

Data was carefully filtered and optimized:
- Removal of personal information
- Filtering of unsafe/toxic outputs
- Elimination of mistaken self-identification
- Deduplication of examples
- Addition of data encouraging proper in-context attribution, hedging, and refusals to minimize hallucination

## 4. Performance Evaluation

Performance degrades when extending beyond 128K tokens but remains usable at the target context length.

## 5. Memorization and Privacy Analysis

### 5.1 Methodology

The paper quantifies memorization as:
- Ratio of generations that match training data compared to all generations
- Using 50-token prefix and 50-token suffix to test extractability
- Classifying as "exactly memorized" (perfect match) or "approximately memorized" (edit distance ≤10%)

### 5.2 Findings

- Gemma 3 models memorize significantly less than prior models (note log scale in results)
- Minimal difference in memorization rates between 4B, 12B, and 27B models
- 1B model shows lower memorization than larger variants
- Higher proportion of approximate vs exact memorization (~24x)
- No personal information detected in outputs classified as memorization

This indicates improved privacy preservation without explicit regularization targeting memorization reduction.

## 8. Conclusion

The Gemma 3 model family represents a significant advancement in open language models, particularly in architectural efficiency, multimodal capabilities, and performance scaling. The 5:1 local-global attention pattern provides a blueprint for memory-efficient context processing, while the Pan & Scan approach offers an elegant solution to variable aspect ratio image processing.

Most notably, the performance improvements—with smaller models matching or exceeding larger predecessors—demonstrate that architectural innovations and training methodology improvements can be as impactful as simply scaling model size. The reduced memorization rates also suggest progress in addressing privacy concerns inherent to large language models.

These innovations extend beyond the specific models described and offer techniques that could benefit the broader AI research community, particularly for developing more efficient, capable, and responsible systems suitable for a range of hardware environments.
